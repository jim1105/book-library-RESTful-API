Find books on a certain subject or genre (i.e scientific books, sci-fi, horror, reference)
Group books together into lists (i.e "my favorite sci-fi books of 2016")
Combine any of the above to create a more complex search query (i.e all horror books published by Stephen Hawking between 1815 and 1820)
Mark a book as "loaned out" to an individual
Remind the individual I loaned my book to that they need to return it by some date I've chosen
Add, remove or update notes about a particular book for later reference
See which books are loaned out and to whom; also see whether they have returned them on time or not
